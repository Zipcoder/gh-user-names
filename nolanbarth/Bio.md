##Nolan Barth Bio:

Hey, my name's Nolan Barth. 

	I'm a professional Heavy Metal guitarist with 
something like 6 years of experience using Linux of various distos and 
more than 10 years of experience putting computers together from parts.

	I've sort of always been the 'guy to call if your computer broke' among 
my close friends and family. Both of my parents are programmers and they
taught me and my siblings critical thinking, problem solving, and logic 
skills from a very early age. I guess you could say that coding was the 
next logical step in my progression from computer hobbyist to full-on
content creator/expert or whatever I'll end up becoming... 


Who knows, right?
