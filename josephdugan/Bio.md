# Short Bio

JD is a former philosophy major. Prior to--in some cases concurrent
with--philosophy, he was a bass guitar player in different varieties
of rock-ish bands, an anthropology major, a martial artist, a bartender,
a wine salesperson, and many other things that may possibly constitute
a mereological object from which an abstraction of a person may be
derived.

After attending one too many philosophy conferences at which the 
desire-belief analysis of 'intention' was defended (from whom was
not always clear), JD qua Joseph decided the discipline would have
no problem--for the time being--making progress (or not) on the correct
analysis of 'intention' without him.

Furthermore, JD recognized that any philosophical writings he produced
would have less to say about a world whose ontological domain is--perhaps in
some way--extended daily by the computer industry, if he did not strive to
gain some experience within, as well as an understanding of, the computational 
arts. He decided the best way to do this was to 'get his hands as dirty as 
possible.'

Consequently, JD pursued some introductory coursework in computer science
while still at university; then continued studies by way of self-learning,
utilizing various internet resources. 

In the autumn of 2015, JD became aware of the Zipcode program. With piqued
interst and a strong desire to become a participant in the software industry,
he applied for the program. He was ecstatic when he learned that he was 
accepted into the January 2016 cohort.
